RP2040-Decoder
===============

This Project is a DIY DCC Decoder for model railroad locomotives which aims to be cost effective.

Features
--------

- DCC digital signal decoding
- Motor load/speed control
- 4 Outputs to drive loads up to 400mA each
- 6 GPIO for lighter loads or custom applications
- Programmable on programming track
- CV Function Mapping
- Board size of 25x20 mm

Getting Started
------------

The [Wiki - Getting started](https://github.com/gab-k/RP2040-Decoder/wiki/Getting-started) page provides a brief overview.
A Description on how to compile and flash the decoder using  Windows can be found [here](https://github.com/gab-k/RP2040-Decoder/wiki/Quick-start-guide-(Windows)).

Note: The decoder is still in early development, there might (will) be bugs as its not tested that much yet.
So suggestions on how to improve things and bug reports are always much appreciated.
The wiki is also work in progress and will be updated to be as comprehensive as possible.
