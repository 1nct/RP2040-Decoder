RP2040-Decoder
===============

This Project is a DIY DCC Decoder for model railroad locomotives which aims to be cost effective.

IMPORTANT NOTE 
---------------
If you are planning to order a few boards, have a look at the dev branch, there is a new revision (1.0) in the works which has not yet been fully tested. The new revision has a number of improvements and is much easier to use. So if you are planning to order boards you might want to be patient or alternatively, if you are adventurous, just order the revision in the dev branch. In addition, the software and documentation in the dev branch brings a number of improvements, so it may also be of interest to owners of the 0.3 revision.

Features
--------

- DCC digital signal decoding
- Motor load/speed control
- 4 Outputs switched by transistors with configurable optional PWM
- 6 additional GPIO for lighter loads or custom applications
- Programmable on programming track
- CV Function Mapping
- Board size of 25x20 mm
- Pre-compiled software available and flashable via USB using your regular file explorer
- Debugging via Serial Wire Debug or optional logging via stdio and UART/USB serial port

Getting Started
------------


The ["Getting Started"](https://github.com/gab-k/RP2040-Decoder/wiki/Getting-started) page provides an overview of the steps required to use the decoder as well as brief instructions for all the necessary steps.

Note: The decoder is still in early development, there might (will) be bugs as its not tested that much yet.
So suggestions on how to improve things and bug reports are always much appreciated.
The wiki is also work in progress and will be updated to be as comprehensive as possible.
