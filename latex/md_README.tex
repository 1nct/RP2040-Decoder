 Further details about the project can be found here\+: \href{https://github.com/GabrielKoppenstein/pico-decoder/wiki}{\texttt{ RP2040-\/\+Decoder Wiki}}

Note\+: The decoder is still in early development, there might (will) be bugs as its not tested that much yet. So suggestions on how to improve things and bug reports are always much appreciated. The wiki is also work in progress and will be updated to be as comprehensive as possible.
